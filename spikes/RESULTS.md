# Spike results

One section per spike (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 0): the question, what we ran, the numbers, go/no-go, and what changed in the PRD.

## Sunjeet: exploration and sign-in integration (HackIIIT, IIIT Delhi)

Validated the new recorder launcher through fresh local Chrome fixtures, without paid services. Six exploration regressions passed: delayed SPA hydration and hidden auth copy, three real access barriers, prerequisite-dependent flow replay with review frames, and duplicate-target/named-field checks. Three ordinary-Chrome sign-in regressions passed: cookies/localStorage survive capture without reloading the real site, a competing window is refused, and cancellation releases the profile reservation. The sign-in suite took 44.24 s, including Chrome's cookie flush wait.

Free TinyFish key and ElevenLabs subscription probes both succeeded on 2026-10-24; ElevenLabs reported a free plan. No speech or agent runs were created by those probes. The implementations retain the existing PRD decisions: public mode does not demand a separate app/login, remote stealth does not prove local replayability, and sign-in uses an ordinary window before automation captures state. No architecture change is proposed. Worker action routing, shared registration of exploration checkpoints and real recording/rendering remain separate integration work; see `packages/explore/IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

### Bounded live EN/HI narration

A temporary smoke test generated one short line per language using the configured ElevenLabs account and premade voices. Both succeeded on `eleven_v4`: EN 3.600 s / 7 timed words, HI 3.040 s / 7 timed words. There were two speech requests for 90 source characters total, with no model fallback. Both clips passed the timing checks and ffprobe measurement; an immediate repeat reused both with zero further speech requests. Temporary scripts, audio and manifests were removed during pre-commit cleanup. This proves generation, timing and exact reuse against the live provider; naturalness still needs a native Hindi listener, and it is not an end-to-end video render.

### Codeforces live exploration check

TinyFish Fetch read the public Codeforces homepage and help page, and Codex produced the product and creative briefs. The normal discovery stage then failed while opening the entrance in local Chrome, before any TinyFish Agent run was created. A separate local Chrome diagnostic subsequently reached HTTP 200, so the local failure was transient; the full exploration was not resumed. The live Agent/stealth path remains unverified by this check. The test was stopped at the user's request, and its temporary scripts and isolated job data were removed.
